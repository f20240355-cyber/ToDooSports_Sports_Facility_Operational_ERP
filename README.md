## Problem Statement

Running a sports facility in 2026 is more operationally complex than most people realise. A mid-sized padel or football club manages dozens of moving parts simultaneously — court schedules, coach availability, equipment stock, locker rentals, membership discounts, and peak-hour pricing — all of which directly affect revenue and customer experience.

Yet the vast majority of facility owners still rely on a combination of WhatsApp messages, paper notebooks, and basic spreadsheets to keep things running. The consequences are predictable and costly:

- **Double-bookings** are common because there is no single source of truth for court availability. A manager takes a booking over the phone while a staff member accepts the same slot on a walk-in basis.
- **Equipment disappears.** Rackets, bibs, and balls are handed out with no tracking system. There is no way to know how many are in circulation at any given moment, which means customers regularly get turned away because stock has run out.
- **Coaches are mismanaged.** Without a structured schedule, coaches get assigned to two courts at the same time, or a customer books a Padel lesson only to find out on arrival that the coach specialises in Football.
- **Pricing is flat and inflexible.** A court at 10 AM on a Tuesday is priced identically to a court at 8 PM on a Friday — the most in-demand slot of the week. Facility owners leave significant revenue on the table by failing to apply surge pricing during peak hours.
- **Maintenance is reactive, not proactive.** Courts are used until they break. There is no system to track accumulated usage hours, no threshold that triggers a maintenance flag, and no way to see at a glance which courts across a facility are operational.
- **Memberships are managed manually.** Discount entitlements are remembered informally, expiry dates are tracked in spreadsheets, and customers regularly receive discounts they are no longer entitled to — or are incorrectly denied discounts they have paid for.
- **Lockers generate passive income, but are never systematically tracked.** Monthly rentals expire without the owner knowing, and lockers sit rented-but-expired for weeks at a time.

The result is a business that is leaking revenue at every level — from pricing and equipment to staffing and memberships — while simultaneously delivering an inconsistent customer experience that drives members away.

## Solution

**TOdooSports** is a purpose-built sports facility management ERP that replaces the chaos of spreadsheets and informal systems with a single, fully integrated backend. Built on the Odoo 19 framework, it enforces business logic at the data layer — meaning rules are not just guidelines that staff can ignore, they are constraints that the system will not allow to be broken.

Every booking flows through a structured sport-first selection process. The system automatically filters facilities, courts, coaches, and equipment based on what the customer wants to play — eliminating mismatched bookings at the source. Pricing adjusts automatically based on the day and time. Membership discounts apply without any manual intervention. Courts flag themselves for maintenance when they reach their usage threshold. Equipment cannot be double-booked across concurrent sessions. And everything — from locker expiry to membership validity — is tracked in real time.

TOdooSports turns operational management from a daily firefight into a system that largely runs itself.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture & Core Mechanics

The backend of TOdooSports is engineered for high-volume, multi-facility operations. Every feature is designed to automate administration, protect inventory, and eliminate human error at the database level.

### 1. Relational Database Design
* **Scalable Hierarchies (One2many & Many2one):** The system relies on a strict parent-child data structure. The `sports.facility` model acts as the master hub, linking directly to its specific courts, locally assigned coaches, and physical equipment inventory. This ensures data remains isolated and accurate per location.
* **Global Tagging (Many2many):** Implemented for `sports.amenity` (e.g., VIP Lounges, Showers, Floodlights) using `widget="many2many_tags"`. This allows facility managers to assign and display multiple amenities to specific courts with a clean, visual UI.

### 2. Business Logic & Computations
* **Dynamic Pricing Engine (`@api.depends`):** The checkout calculation goes far beyond simple addition. A single, complex compute method recalculates the total price in real-time by chaining variables: *(Court Base Rate × Dynamic Surge Multiplier) + Coach Fees + Equipment Subtotals − Active Membership Discounts*. 
* **Cascading Data Funnels (`@api.onchange`):** To prevent user error, the booking form acts as a strict funnel. If an admin changes the selected 'Sport' halfway through a booking, the system automatically wipes the previously selected Facility, Court, and Equipment fields, ensuring mismatched data can never be submitted to the database.

### 3. Data Integrity & Operational Security
* **Absolute Overlap Prevention (`@api.constrains`):** The backbone of the system's security. Database-level ORM constraints ensure physical realities are respected:
  * **Court Logic:** Completely blocks any new reservation that overlaps with a confirmed booking's time slot.
  * **Staff Logic:** Prevents coaches from being double-booked across different courts simultaneously.
  * **Inventory Logic:** Calculates real-time equipment availability and blocks any transaction that exceeds physical stock limits.

### 4. Advanced UI & Visual Management
* **Workflow Automation (States & Statusbars):** Bookings, Lockers, and Courts utilize `state` Selection fields paired with `widget="statusbar"`. This gives staff a clear, visual pipeline (e.g., Draft ➔ Confirmed ➔ Done) and restricts certain actions based on the current state.
* **Visual Data Cues:** Tree view decorators (`decoration-success` for paid/available, `decoration-danger` for unpaid/maintenance) provide instant visual feedback to receptionists handling fast-paced walk-ins.
* **Contextual Domain Filters:** XML domain filters are heavily utilized to create a foolproof UI. Dropdowns dynamically restrict choices based on upstream selections—for example, the 'Equipment' dropdown will *only* display rackets that physically exist at the facility where the court is currently being booked.

### 5. Advanced Framework Integrations
* **CRM Inheritance (`_inherit`):** Instead of building a custom customer database from scratch, the app safely extends Odoo's native `res.partner` (Contacts) model. It injects custom fields like Membership Plans, Expiry Dates, and Active Discounts directly into the core CRM without breaking native Odoo functionality.
* **Automated Housekeeping (`ir.cron`):** Background server scripts run nightly to handle passive administration. They automatically audit the database to release expired locker rentals back into the available pool and flag outdated memberships, requiring zero manual input from staff.
* **Professional Sequencing (`ir.sequence`):** Replaces default database IDs with auto-generated, professional alphanumeric references (e.g., `BK/2026/00001`), essential for clean B2B invoicing and customer receipts.
